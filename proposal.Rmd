## Project Objective

A maximum of 5 sentences outlining the "big picture" objective(s) of the project.
It should not be technical, and answer the "Why One Should Care" question - i.e. justify the managerial relevance.
A non-expert should be able to understand it.

## Research Question

SOMETHING (technical jargon can used added here -- **one** sentence!)

**Sub-Questions:** (**max of 2**, if any)

* If none, write "None"

## Data

Below is a list of datasets I need for my thesis:

**Template:**

* Dataset name
  * Where does it come from? (1 sentence)
  * Why do I need it? (1 sentence)
  * How will I obtain access to it? (1 sentence)
  * What are the main variables I need from this data?

## Methodology

### Empirical Modelling

Write down as best you can your proposed empirical modelling strategy.
Carefully explain any notation you introduce.

What challenges will you face linking planned results to answering the research question?

### From Raw Data to Empirical Model

Explain how you anticipate going from the data sets above to something that can go into your empirical model.
Dot points detailing an approximate workflow are sufficient.

## Communicating Results

Explain how you plan to report your results. 
For example, what tables and figures do you expect your thesis will contain.
Will the table(s) be a regression table(s) or something else?
Will the figure(s) be a box-plot, scatter plot, something else?

## Timetable

Detail your proposed timetable for completing the study.
It's non-binding, but should provide a plan of attack.
I suggest making a table [here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) and copying the markdown in to this document

Key moments to include:

* Literature review 
* Collect raw data
* Complete data cleaning
* Preliminary Results
* Updated Results
* Complete thesis draft

## Challenges & Opportunities

List any challenges you might anticipate along the way.
These are good to think about in advance so we can talk through how to get ahead of them early.
Most likely these are knowledge gaps that you will want to bridge.
For each challenge, think through how to map these into an opportunity to develop your skills and how you might go about it.

* Challenge 1
  * Opportunity:

Unanticipated challenges will also arise, we'll face those as we find them.

**Sub-Questions:** (if any)

* If none, write "None"

## Type of Question

The research question I will answer is a **INSERT_ANSWER** question.

Replace **INSERT_ANSWER** with one of the choices below:^[These question types are borrowed from a paper by Jeff Leek and Roger Peng in their paper: "What is the question?"[-@Leek1314].

Once you have made your choice, remove all text except the first sentence of this section.

## Data

Keep the choice which applies to your project:

- I have downloaded the necessary data for this project. The script to download the data is [`data/download-data.R`](data/download-data.R)^[
The instructors need to be able to run this script so be clear what libraries are needed to be installed.
]
- I have not yet downloaded the final data for this project because the event I want to study has yet to occur, but have a working R script that downloads data for an earlier time period. The script to download the data is [`data/download-data.R`](data/download-data.R)^[
The instructors need to be able to run this script.
]
  - **NOTES:** Only use this option if you are using the Twitter API, and the event you plan to study has not occurred by the proposal deadline
